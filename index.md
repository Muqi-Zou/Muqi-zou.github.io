## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Purdue University, co-advised by [Prof. Dongyan Xu](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dxu/) and [Prof. Ruoyu(Fish) Wang](https://ruoyuwang.me). I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign(UIUC) . My research interests lie in program analysis, binary analysis, and decompilation.
Specifically, I develop novel methodologies to verify the semantics and correctness of code generated by decompilers and large language models (LLMs), leveraging symbolic execution and SMT solvers at both the source-code and binary levels. 
In addition, I contribute to the debugging and root-cause analysis of state-of-the-art decompilers [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20author%3AMuqi-Zou), helping identify and resolve critical issues that impact decompilation accuracy and reliability.
